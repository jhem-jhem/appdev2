1. Introduction (100-150 words)
   * Last semester, I gained much experience with GitHub. I know now how to implement commands such as git push and other basic syntax. Knowing that I also want to become a UI/UX designer, I am aware that learning how to code is essential as well. Even though my major is design-oriented, but with knowledge of basic coding will be able to do better. I don't know much about backend development or Node.js at the moment, but I am ready to learn it. I know that backend development is needed because it manages the data and logic of a website or an application. I would like to know how all things work according to god's will.
2. Course Expectations (200-300 words)
   * Throughout this course, I would like to learn how to create APIs and know how to work with databases. I feel that backend coding is a key component of making a system function correctly. I have heard a few memes saying that backend coding is extremely difficult because of this complexity, and I would like to know why. Although I have little experience, I am hoping to learn more. I want to know how backend and frontend collaborate to make a complete system. I also look forward to learning how to handle databases because it is helpful in storing and retrieving data in a system. I believe that learning backend development will assist me in my studies and career. Although my knowledge or experience more is about being UI/UX designer, knowing how the backend works will make me a more skilled about my knowledge. It will also help me to communicate more effectively with developers and design more feasible designs. Knowing frontend and backend and by having this knowledge I can pursue my career in the future.
3. Challenges and Areas for Improvement (150-200 words)
   * I think the more challenging or I find difficult to this subject is about error handling HAHAHAHA because we all know the error is ALWAYS part of the progress, I don't believe that there's a person didn't experience about error in coding, so for me it consume a lot of time for me to solve an error, there is also a scenario that I almost cried because of this to the point that I'm asking myself why I am here in this course even if in the first place I have zero knowledge about this, but look where I am now chz, kidding aside I am thankful to where I am right now despite of a lot of problems I encountered but still I continue in the long run to achieve some small achievements I gain and I learned on the past few years. To improve, I will practice more and ask for help when needed. Watching tutorials, reading documentation, and doing hands-on activities will also help me understand backend development better. I believe that with enough effort, I can overcome these challenges.


4. Expectations from the Instructor (100-150 words)
   * Actually it is not just me, I believe we the students of you po, we all know how grateful we are having a lecturer or instructor like you in the first place, the reason why is because you help us a lot and guided us in every progress we make just like accommodating our questions and concern and provided us a easy instructions that help us a lot to solve our problem. You help us to mitigated our problems by giving us a reviewer in exam resulting to have a passed grade. We don't even say it often but thanks be to God for everything, Sir.
5. Final Thoughts (Optional, 50-100 words)
   * In my experience even if we are having a discussion sometimes it really hard to understand some technical words you said or discussed, sometimes we need to search about the word to fully understand what is the meaning of that and sometime we watch a video on youtube to help us more understand on how the topic works, and I think some video on youtube is easy to understand because they provide a visual explanation about it like how it works and they give a some examples in real-world that connect in the coding.
